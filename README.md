# Task
## It is necessary to implement a graphical utility using WPF to view information about the composition of an arbitrary .NET assembly.

*The contents of the loaded assembly should be presented in a hierarchical form (`TreeView` control):
+ namespaces
  + data types
    + fields, properties and methods (information about methods in addition to the name must include a signature, about fields and properties - type).*

*Obligatory is the use of **MVVM-pattern**, as well as the use of `INotifyPropertyChanged` and `ICommand`.*
